exit code 1 = error <-- stops at this point

exit code 0 = worked

echo "?" in terminal
if it gives you back 0
means it has worked

anything between try and catch will be caught but you can be specific with what you want to catch




(Exception e) <-- parent of all exceptions
theres different types of exceptions
NumberFormatException
NosuchfileException -- no such file found

theres two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked
Checked- anticipate it
Unchecked - did not anticipate - inside program LOGIC is incorrect


checked:
File file = new File("./foo.txt");
FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream <--- this was highlighted in red so the program
is telling you that theres an issue before you even compile your code
reflects some error

to fix this try to catch it

use throw Exceptions-class can be used

Unchecked:
System.out.println(10/0); <-- unchecked it is not in the try-catch but computer should be able to deal with it
to fix - fix your LOGIC
use throw RuntimeException-class or any of its subclasses on the unchecked

you can throw your exception to the JVM/MAIN
you wouldnt want to do this but if youre testing a code you can just throw exception to the program
