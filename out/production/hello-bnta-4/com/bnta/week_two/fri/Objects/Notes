Class- a blueprint to represent anything in the real world/template allows you to identify properties and behaviours of an object
this is what makes up an object

you can model anything in the real world using class

Properties e.g of headphones characteristics
colour
weight
brand
material

behaviour- things they can do
the sound
on/off



What would you do with this template?
replicating the objects


objects- real thing


Everything is an object - by default if you make a person object, string object - all objects whatever
method is in the object class it is also available within the other objects
objects, arrays --> object class as their super class
primitives are not objects


parent of class of objects == object class
so everything

tostrring method - you need to overrride it and rewrite it when you want to print it
